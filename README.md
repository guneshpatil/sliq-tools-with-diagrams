# Software Lifecycle in Quotes - Tools & Diagrams

Welcome to the **SLIQ (Software Lifecycle in Quotes)** repository! This project hosts a collection of diagrams and tools used throughout the software lifecycle, with a focus on illustrating concepts discussed in the series *Software Lifecycle in Quotes*.

All diagrams in this repository are created using **PlantUML**, making it easy to understand and visualize various stages and processes within the software development lifecycle.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This repository aims to provide visual representations of the tools, processes, and methodologies commonly used in software development. From Requirement Analysis to Deployment, you'll find well-defined diagrams that correspond to each phase of the lifecycle. These diagrams are designed to help you better understand how various stages connect and what tools might be involved in each step.

## ðŸ’¡ How to Use this Repository

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repo to your local machine using:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sliq-tools-with-plantuml.git

2. **View the Diagrams**:
Each `.puml` file in the `diagrams/` folder contains PlantUML syntax for different lifecycle stages. You can open these files in any PlantUML viewer or integrate them into your project.

3. **Generate Diagrams Locally**
If you'd like to regenerate the diagrams from the `.puml` files, follow these steps:

- **Install PlantUML** on your machine. [PlantUML Installation Guide](https://plantuml.com/starting)
- Run the following command:
   ```bash
   plantuml diagrams/*.puml

4. **Use IDE plugins like in IntelliJ**

### Modify for Your Needs
Feel free to modify and adapt the diagrams for your own projects. Use the scripts in the `src/` folder to regenerate any files after modifications.

## ðŸ”§ Tools Used
- **PlantUML**: All diagrams are created using the open-source PlantUML tool, making it easy to create and visualize complex diagrams.

## ðŸŽ¯ Use This Repo to Your Advantage

- **For Education**: If you're new to software development, these diagrams provide a visual guide to better understand the software lifecycle.
- **For Your Projects**: You can incorporate these diagrams directly into your own documentation to explain various phases of your project lifecycle.
- **Customization**: Modify and tweak the `.puml` files to suit your own team's processes or for personal learning.

## ðŸ’¬ Feedback & Contributions
Contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions for improving the diagrams or adding new tools to illustrate different stages of the lifecycle, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
